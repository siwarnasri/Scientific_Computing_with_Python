# Free Code Camp: Scientific Computing with Python: Projects.
### Repository containing all the 5 projects of the "Scientific Computing with Python" module on the Freecodecamp.org (FCC)

In this repository you can find the 5 projects made by me to complete the Scientific Computing with Python course on freeCodeCamp. The links in the first column will redirect you to each project, hosted and made in [Replit](https://replit.com/). The links in the second column will redirect you to the code of each project, separated into individual folders in this repository.

**These projects are not meant to be the best ones. They can probably be improved.**
